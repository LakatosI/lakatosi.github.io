                <p>
                    After having my old TiddlyWiki-based site for quite some time, I decided it was
                    time for a fresh start. Welcome to the new version of my personal website!
                </p>

                <h2>What's New</h2>
                <p>
                    This new site is built with simplicity in mind. No frameworks, no build steps,
                    just clean HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal is to have a fast,
                    lightweight site that's easy to maintain and update.
                </p>

                <p>The new site includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>A blog</strong> - Where I'll share my thoughts on software development and technology</li>
                    <li><strong>Tools repository</strong> - A collection of standalone HTML tools you can use right in your browser</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean design</strong> - Simple, readable, and focused on content</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What's Coming</h2>
                <p>
                    I have some ideas for tools I want to build and share, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Text comparison and diff tools</li>
                    <li>Code formatters and validators</li>
                    <li>Calculators and converters</li>
                    <li>And whatever else seems useful!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Tech Stack</h2>
                <p>
                    As I mentioned, this site is intentionally simple. It's built with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plain HTML5</li>
                    <li>CSS3 with CSS custom properties for theming</li>
                    <li>Vanilla JavaScript (when needed)</li>
                    <li>Hosted on GitHub Pages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. No build process, no dependencies,
                    no complexity. Just content and code.
                </p>

                <h2>Stay Tuned</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to start sharing more content here. Whether it's technical blog posts,
                    useful web tools, or experiments with new technologies, this site will be the
                    home for it all.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks for visiting, and check back soon for more updates!
